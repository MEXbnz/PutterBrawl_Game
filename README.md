This portfolio contains all of the code for an indie game that is currently in the making, with a golf-inspired rouge-like theme.

The important information is within the 'scripts' folder.

The purpose of displaying this code is to show how both, my code and I improve as I become a better programmer, and more work it put toward the game.
